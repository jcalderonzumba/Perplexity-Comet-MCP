 * Validate a user-supplied upload path against the optional allowlist root

 * and require the real path to live under the configured root — defends
 * against an LLM-controlled `filePath` exfiltrating arbitrary local files
 * (e.g. `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.aws/credentials`).
 *
 * When the env var is unset we keep permissive behaviour (backward
 * compatibility) but block a denylist of paths that obviously have no
 * business being uploaded to a webpage.
 *
 * Security notes:
 * - The former `existsSync` pre-check has been removed to eliminate the
 *   TOCTOU window between existence check and `realpathSync`. A missing
 *   path now produces an ENOENT from `realpathSync` which is caught and
 *   re-thrown with a friendly message.
 * - `COMET_UPLOAD_ROOT="/"` and `COMET_UPLOAD_ROOT=homedir()` are
 *   explicitly rejected because they would pass every path through.
 *
 * Returns the canonical absolute path, or throws with a user-facing message.
